# Analytical Mechanics

Simulations for the course "Analytical Mechanics" at the University of Bologna. Most are made using [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/), [`scipy`](https://scipy.org/), [`sympy`](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) and [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/).
To get started, install all required packages with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run any simulation like any other Python program:

```bash
python rotating_pendulum.py
```
